.SH NAME
.PP
xattrvi \- view and edit userspace extended attributes of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
xattrvi [options] <filename>
.SH HOW TO USE
.PP
Used on a file, xattrvi will write extended attributes from userspace to
a temporary file which is opened in the editor specified by $EDITOR.
Attributes can then be edited and changed and new attributes will be
(re)written to the file, deleted one\[aq]s will be removed.
.PP
xattrvi is only intended for userspace\-xattrs and the "user."\-prefix
is implicitly prepended in the editable text.
xattrs from other namespaces can not be edited with xattrvi.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\f[B]\-h, \-\-help\f[] show commandline options
.PP
\f[B]\-e, \-\-encoding\f[] encoding to be used for value\-decoding,
defaults to utf\-8
.PP
\f[B]\-\-hide\-undecodable\f[] hide entries whose value could not be
decoded properly
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Keys may not contain the character :.
Although supported by filesystems, xattrvi does not support this
character for keys, but reserves it for key\-value\-separation in the
display\-file.
Values, though, may include this character.
.SH XATTRVIRC
.PP
The file ~/.config/xattrvi/xattrvirc can be used for further
configuration.
The syntax is one option per line, empty lines and lines beginning with
a # are ignored.
.PP
Currently, two types of options are supported: * ignore: <full\-key>
allows to ignore certain keys entirely.
They will not be retrieved, displayed or editable.
* value_encoding: <full\-key>: <encoding> allows to set certain custom
encodings for the value\-field of an attribute.
The encoding must be provided as a Python3\-type encoding.
.PP
Please note that keys provided in xattrvirc are not assumed to have any
prefix, so the user.\-prefix for keys must be specified here.
